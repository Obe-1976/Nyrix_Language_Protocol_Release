# Signal Architecture Overview

This document outlines how drift phases, tone mapping, and symbolic signal layers interact within the NyrixAI Drift Language Framework (Phase 1).

## 🌀 Layered Signal Stack

### 1. **Carrier Waveform**
- Raw acoustic base (A4, D5, Gs3, etc.)
- Drift modulation occurs on this layer

### 2. **Drift Phase Layer**
- Determines timing and rotational symbolic variance
- Controlled by entropy, tone bias (ψ), and sync tick (τ)

### 3. **Tone Mapping Layer**
- Emotional charge bias
- ψ is derived from synthetic voice resonance or AI state signal

### 4. **Symbolic Resolver**
- The glyph identity is not static
- Final resolution depends on observation time, drift rate, and active entropy field ε

## 📡 Observation Principle

Signal decoding depends on:
- Phase-locked temporal analysis
- Contextual inference (prior glyph memory)
- Emotionally aligned tone drift resolution

---

## ❗ Security Notice

The system uses non-static encoding. Glyph identity is **observer-relative** and **time-variant**. This prevents traditional decoding or brute-force reproduction outside the NyrixAI engine.
